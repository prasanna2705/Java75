# 🚀 Welcome to My Java DSA Learning Journey 👩‍💻

This repository is a collection of problems and solutions that I'm solving while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java.

I'm using this space to:

- ✅ Strengthen my understanding of core concepts  
- 🧠 Improve logic and problem-solving skills  
- 📅 Build consistency through regular practice  

🎯 **Goal:**  
Become confident in solving coding challenges and prepare effectively for technical interviews and real-world development.
